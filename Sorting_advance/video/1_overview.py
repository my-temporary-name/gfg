# Overview of Sorting algorithm

# 1. Binary Array : efficiently sorted using Partition of Quick Sort (lomuto , hoare and Naive) // naive is stable
# 2. Array with three values: Can be solved using quick sort partitioning
# 3. Array of size n and small ranged values: Counting Sort O(N+K) under assumption all values are small. O(K) space
# 4. Array of size n and range is of size n^2 or n^3: Radix Sort O(n) time and O(n) space
# 5. Array of uniformly distributed data over a range eg: [0.1 to 1.0] : Use Bucket Sort
# 6. When Memory writes are costly: Selection sort and Cycle sort
# 7. When adjacent swaps are allowed: Bubble Sort and Cocktail Sort
# 8. When array size is small: Insertion Sort
# 9. When available extra space is small: Shell Sort O(n(logn)^2) time
