# Application of DFS

# 1. Cycle Detection in Directed Graph
# 2. Topological Sorting # Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u v, 
#                          vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
# 3. Strongly Connected Components
# 4. Solving maze and similar puzzles
# 5. Path Finding

# Backtracking algorithms like Knight Tour's Problem, Rat in a Maze, N-Queen Problem, Sudoku, are based on DFS.
