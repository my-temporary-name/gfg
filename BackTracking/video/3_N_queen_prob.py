# N Queen Problem
# The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
# ex: N = 4
# O/P: [ [0, 1, 0, 0],
#        [0, 0, 0, 1],
#        [1, 0, 0, 0],
#        [0, 0, 1, 0]]

# ex: N=3 
# O/P: False (No solution exists)

# Naive Approach:
# Generate all possible configurations of queens on the board and print a configuration that satisfies the given constraints.
# Generate Recursion Tree for N=4

# Refer to video, it's good to understand the problem statement and constraints. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/ds-with-python/track/DSASPPY-Backtracking/video/NzA3Mw%3D%3D

# A utility function to check if a queen can
# be placed on board[row][col]. Note that this
# function is called when "col" queens are
# already placed in columns from 0 to col -1.
# So we need to check only left side for
# attacking queens
def isSafe(board, row, col):

	# Check this row on left side
	for i in range(col):
		if board[row][i] == 1:
			return False

	# Check upper diagonal on left side
	for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):
		if board[i][j] == 1:
			return False

	# Check lower diagonal on left side
	for i, j in zip(range(row, N, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):
		if board[i][j] == 1:
			return False

	return True

def solveNQUtil(board, col):
	# base case: If all queens are placed
	# then return true
	if col >= N:
		return True

	# Consider this column and try placing
	# this queen in all rows one by one
	for i in range(N):

		if isSafe(board, i, col):
			# Place this queen in board[i][col]
			board[i][col] = 1

			# recur to place rest of the queens
			if solveNQUtil(board, col + 1) == True:
				return True

			# If placing queen in board[i][col
			# doesn't lead to a solution, then
			# queen from board[i][col]
			board[i][col] = 0

	# if the queen can not be placed in any row in
	# this column col then return false
	return False

# This function solves the N Queen problem using
# Backtracking. It mainly uses solveNQUtil() to
# solve the problem. It returns false if queens
# cannot be placed, otherwise return true and
# placement of queens in the form of 1s.
# note that there may be more than one
# solutions, this function prints one of the
# feasible solutions.
