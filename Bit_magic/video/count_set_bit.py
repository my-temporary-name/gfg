# count set bits: find the number of set bits (bits with value 1) in a number

# naive approach: The basic method we use to manually convert the number into binary and count the number of 1s in it.
# Time complexity: O(number of bits in the number)

# Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm: The algorithm is based on the fact that the last set bit of a number n is n & (n-1).
# One by one we will unset the rightmost set bit of the number n and increment the count of set bits.
# Example n:40 = 101000, 32 = 100000, 0 = 000000 So total set bits = 2

# Time complexity: O(number of set bits)
